## Impact of Comprehensive Generation

### If We Generate All Tests

| Metric | Current | After Phase 4 | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Test Files** | 61 | 450+ | +638% |
| **Test Cases** | 1,246 | 12,000+ | +863% |
| **Coverage** | 13% | 90%+ | +577% |
| **Lines of Code** | ~25,000 | ~180,000 | +620% |
| **Manual Hours Saved** | 0 | 330+ | ∞ |

### Per-Scene Impact

#### Simple Scene (no items)
- **Current**: 23 tests (look, move only)
- **Target**: 25 tests (+ edge cases, workflows)
- **Increase**: +2 tests (9%)

#### Moderate Scene (items, no monsters)
- **Current**: 23 tests (look, move only)
- **Target**: 120-180 tests
- **Increase**: +97-157 tests (422-683%)

**Example - dam scene**:
- Current: 23 tests (look, move)
- Items: bolt, dam, bubbl, cpanl
- Potential tests:
  - Take command: 20 tests (4 items × 5 test types)
  - Examine command: 16 tests (4 items × 4 test types)
  - Drop command: 12 tests
  - Inventory: 8 tests
  - State validation: 15 tests
  - Workflows: 10 tests
- **Total**: ~100 tests

#### Complex Scene (items + monsters + puzzles)
- **Current**: 23 tests
- **Target**: 200-300 tests
- **Increase**: +177-277 tests (770-1,204%)
