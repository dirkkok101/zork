  "examineText": "This is a suspicious-looking individual of medium build, leaning casually against the wall while watching you with calculating eyes. He holds a large sack that appears to contain various stolen items, and his posture suggests he's ready to move quickly if needed. Most notably, he is armed with a deadly stiletto that glints in the light, which he handles with obvious familiarity. His clothing is dark and practical, designed for stealth and quick movement.",
