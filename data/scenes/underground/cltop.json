  "description": "You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its south wall.  From here\nthere is a marvelous view of the Canyon and parts of the Frigid River\nupstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs still\nappear to loom far above.  Following the Canyon upstream (north and\nnorthwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. \nFortunately, my vision is better than average and I can discern the\ntop of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the\nwest and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles\naround.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.",
