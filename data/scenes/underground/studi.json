The walls\nand floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. \nStrangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and\nnorthwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An\nextremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although\nyou might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back\ndown.",
